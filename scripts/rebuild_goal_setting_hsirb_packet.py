PAGE3_TEXT = """1. Description of Project or Proposal
This study is a local replication of the foundational Schweitzer, Ordóñez, and Douma (2004) experiment examining whether performance goals drive unethical behavior. Participants complete anagram puzzles under one of four conditions: do-your-best, mere goal, reward goal, or personal goal. This design directly addresses several methodological limitations of the original 2004 study, tests key boundary conditions—specifically trait loss aversion and goal proximity—and contributes to a multi-site global replication project. Data collection occurs in two phases: a pilot session to calibrate materials and administration procedures, followed by a main study session for hypothesis testing. Both pilot and main materials are supplied for HSIRB review.

2. Population of Human Subjects
Undergraduate students enrolled in Business Administration courses (specifically BSAD 101, meeting in Powell 140) at Nicholls State University, as well as working professionals. All participants must be 18 years of age or older.

3. Research Procedures and Data Collection
Pilot session: (1) Consent using Appendix B pilot form; (2) two 1-minute practice rounds; (3) timed anagram performance rounds under do-your-best instructions; (4) anonymous productivity report (no cash self-payment; participants may use a phone to access an online Scrabble dictionary via a QR code on the report); (5) brief questionnaires; (6) pilot appreciation letter.

Main study: (1) Consent using Appendix B2 main study form; (2) two 1-minute practice rounds; (3) random assignment to do-your-best, mere goal, personal goal, or reward goal; (4) seven 1-minute performance rounds; (5) eighth-round unique anagram for anonymous linking (participants are told this round does not count toward payment); (6) demographics and trait measures while the researcher is present; (7) while the researcher is out of the room, participants privately check their work using a phone to access an online Scrabble dictionary via a QR code on the productivity report, complete an anonymous productivity report for rounds 1–7, perform private self-payment from a $14 cash envelope per the report instructions, seal the productivity report and cash envelope in a large envelope, and deposit materials in designated boxes (workbook folder and sealed large envelope separately); (8) main study debriefing sheet.

""" + REPEAT_PARTICIPATION

PAGE4_TEXT = """4. Research Objectives
Our primary objective is to conduct a constructive replication of the foundational Schweitzer et al. (2004) study, correcting its methodological limitations while maintaining its core strengths. Second, we aim to investigate when and for whom performance goals lead to unethical behavior. By testing how trait loss aversion and goal proximity influence overstatement, we provide a direct empirical test of the loss aversion mechanism theorized by Ordóñez and Wu (2013). These findings will help strengthen the empirical basis of the goal-setting literature and offer new theoretical insights for behavioral ethics.

5. Research Questions or Hypotheses
H1. People with specific challenging goals (i.e., personal, mere, or reward goals) are more likely to overstate their performance than people without specific challenging goals (i.e., do-your-best condition).
H2. Challenging goal type is related to overstating performance. People with reward goals are more likely to overstate their performance than those with mere goals, who in turn are more likely to overstate their performance than those with personal goals.
H3a. People who fail to reach their goal by a smaller margin are more likely to overstate their performance than if they were to fail to reach their goal by a larger margin.
H3b. People who reach their goal are less likely to overstate their performance than if they failed to reach the goal.
H4. People with greater trait loss aversion are more likely to overstate their performance.
H5. The relationship between trait loss aversion and overstating behavior is amplified in trials where people failed their goal by a smaller margin than when they failed by a larger margin.

6. Educational Justification
This project is part of a global multi-site initiative designed to train student researchers and junior faculty in rigorous, open-science replication methodologies. By engaging with a conditionally accepted Registered Report, local co-investigators and research assistants gain firsthand experience in pre-registration, double-blind administration, and collaborative behavioral science research.

7. Recruitment Method & Script
Recruitment occurs via classroom visits using approved informational flyers. Two flyer versions are included (Appendix A for pilot sessions, Appendix A2 for main study); only the version matching the session is shown. Both pilot and main recruitment materials are supplied for HSIRB review. Instructors may offer course credit or bonus points. The main-study flyer mentions a small cash reward of at least $7.00 with opportunity for up to $14.00; the pilot flyer does not mention cash compensation.

Pilot script: You are invited to participate in a pilot session for a research study examining decision-making during cognitive tasks. This session takes approximately one hour, has received IRB ethics clearance, and helps refine procedures before main data collection. There is no cash compensation. Participation is voluntary and anonymous.

Main study script: You are invited to participate in a research study examining decision-making during cognitive tasks. This study takes approximately one hour and has received IRB ethics clearance. Depending on your instructor's policy, you may receive course credit, bonus points, or a small cash reward of at least $7.00 with opportunity for up to $14.00 total. Participation is voluntary and anonymous."""

PAGE5_TEXT = """8. Subject Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion:
- Undergraduate students or working professionals
- 18 years of age or older
Exclusion:
- Individuals under 18 years of age

9. Subject Benefits & Costs
Benefits to Subjects:
Pilot session participants receive no cash compensation. They may receive course credit or bonus points at their instructor's discretion and receive a written appreciation letter explaining how pilot data support calibration for the main study.

Main study participants receive direct financial compensation through the self-payment procedure, keeping at least $7.00 and up to $14.00 depending on their assigned instructions and performance (averaging about $10.00). They also receive a detailed debriefing sheet explaining the logic and value of open-science replication research.

Benefits to Others/Society:
Strengthening the empirical foundation of the dark-side of goal setting literature, generating a shared understanding between goal setting and behavioral ethics scholars, and developing novel theoretical insights to guide organizational practices.

Payment/Compensation:
Pilot session: No cash compensation is provided.

Main study only: All main-study participants receive an envelope containing $14.00 at the start of the session. Payment amounts are stated on each participant's productivity report during the private self-payment step. Those in the 'do your best', 'mere goal', and 'personal goal' conditions are instructed to keep $10.00. Those in the 'reward goal' condition are instructed to keep $7.00 plus an additional $1.00 for each scored round (rounds 1–7) in which they met the site-calibrated goal (on average, approximately $10.00). Unearned cash is returned in the cash envelope, which is sealed with the productivity report in a large envelope while the researcher is out of the room. Participant-facing materials describe a small cash reward of at least $7.00 with opportunity for up to $14.00 total.

Costs:
Participation requires approximately one hour of time. There are no financial costs to the subjects.

10. Basis of Exemption / Justification
The study qualifies for exempt review under Category 2 of the revised Common Rule (45 CFR 46.104(d)(2)). Data are collected via behavioral tests (an anagram task) and survey procedures. No participant names, IDs, or other identifying information are recorded on any data collection sheets, ensuring participants cannot be identified, directly or through linked identifiers. While we correlate task performance with self-reported productivity reports using a unique eighth-round anagram, this linking mechanism is entirely anonymous and never associated with any student identity."""

PAGE6_TEXT = """11. Statement of Risk & Mitigation
Risk Statement:
The study presents minimal risk. The anagram task may cause mild frustration or performance anxiety, but no more than everyday schoolwork or standard puzzles. While participants have an opportunity to over-report performance or keep unearned money, all data are completely anonymous and cannot be linked to individual identities.

Mitigation:
To protect participants, the design is double-blind, and no names or student IDs are ever written on the study workbooks or productivity reports. Signed consent forms are collected and stored separately. The researcher leaves the room during grading, self-payment, and report submission. A unique eighth-round anagram is used for anonymous data linking. Finally, participants receive a detailed debriefing, and contact information for the Nicholls Counseling Center is provided.

12. Data Collection, Storage, & Access
Collection Methods:
Data collection uses paper-and-pencil materials, including a task workbook (practice and performance anagram rounds, goal commitment, trait loss aversion, and demographics), a separate productivity report for self-reported performance, and a follow-up survey for manipulation and data quality checks. Hard copies are collected in a secure box.

Storage:
Hard-copy workbooks and productivity reports are stored in a locked office in the Department of Management and Marketing at Nicholls State University. De-identified, anonymized electronic datasets are maintained on secure, password-protected computers and shared publicly on the Open Science Framework (OSF) to facilitate open-science collaboration.

Confidentiality Procedures:
Participants remain completely anonymous. No names, email addresses, or student IDs are written on the workbooks, productivity reports, or survey forms. Signed consent forms are stored in a separate locked cabinet from the raw data sheets. Anonymized data are linked via a unique eighth-round anagram rather than any personal identifier, and the de-identified spreadsheet is shared publicly on the OSF.

Access:
The principal investigator and local co-investigators have access to the raw paper materials. De-identified, anonymous data are shared with our research collaborators across the multi-site initiative and made publicly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF).

Retention:
Paper materials will be retained in a locked office for five to seven years in accordance with APA guidelines, after which they will be shredded. The anonymized electronic dataset will be preserved indefinitely on the OSF for replication and meta-analysis."""

PAGE7_TEXT = """13. Consent Procedures
Two written informed consent forms are included for HSIRB review: Appendix B (pilot session) and Appendix B2 (main study). Only the form matching the session is shown to participants. Each form details the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits, emphasizing that participation is entirely voluntary and that participants may withdraw at any time without penalty. The main-study form describes cash compensation; the pilot form states that no cash compensation is provided. Students who choose not to participate are offered an equivalent alternative assignment for equal course credit.
